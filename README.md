# Password_Checker
The purpose of this program is to test passwords for strength

How to correctly run executable?
  1. Save all test passwords in the password.txt file in the correct format
  2. Make sure you have all 3 files (OneThousand.txt, password.txt, and .exe) all in the same directory
  3. Run the executable file

Remember that the best method to really protect sensitive information with a password is to implement
    a password manager that can generate random string, as apposed to just creating one of your own.

This is a open source project. I have linked the .cpp file for review to see exactly what makes a 
good password hope this helps someone!
